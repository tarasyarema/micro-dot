# .config/micro

Just my custom Micro configuration files, i.e. bindings, options, and plugins.

As I use this from my Linux laptop (via Alacritty) and my Windows PC (via Powershell), I want to have the same configurations.

## Install

1. Clone this repo in your `~/.config/micro` folder
2. Run the install script, there are Windows Powershell and Bash versions.

## Configuration

### Bindings

Look at them in the `bindigs.json` file.

The main idea is to make them as similar to VS Code as possible. 

### Plugins

The plugins I use are in the `plugins.txt` file.

## Options

For the moment I'm using the default options.
